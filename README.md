## SBT Stups

SBT-stups is an sbt plugin that contains a set of related tasks for deploying
sbt applications into stups environments. This includes logging creating
`scm-source.json` file, logging into [pierone](https://github.com/zalando-stups/pierone)
and creating a new application version into [kio](https://github.com/zalando-stups/kio)

### Installation

Simply put the following into your `build/plugins.sbt` file

```sbt
addSbtPlugin("org.zalando" % "sbt-stups" % "0.3.0")
```

For this plugin to work, you need to have the following installed on your system and
available in your path

* git
* pierone
* kio
* zaws

Since SBT-stups is an autoplugin, you don't need to do anything explicit to enable it.

### Usage

Before being able to use the plugin, you have to configure the following settings
on your building:

- kioTeamName: your team name as known by kio
- pierOneUrl: pier one url where docker images should be published

There are other settings available, as we will see below.

This sbt-plugin is deliberately designed to have a small minimal set of tasks which you
integrate with your current sbt build. The plugin has the following tasks

* createScmSource: This creates a `scm-source.json` file. Configure the the `scmSourceDirectory`
to the location of where you want the file to be created. By default it is created in your base
directory however if you are using something like [sbt-docker](https://github.com/marcuslonnberg/sbt-docker)
you should probably use something like
```sbt
scmSourceDirectory := (stagingDirectory in Universal).value
```
* pierOneLogin: This logs into pierone. This should be done before pushing your repository
into docker, i.e. if you are using the sbt-docker plugin.
```sbt
(dockerPush in docker) := (dockerPush in docker) dependsOn pierOneLogin
```
* maiLogin: This runs the `mai` command line tool to set up AWS login credentials. You usually
dont need to use this task directly as `createKioVersion` will call this automatically. Use the 
`maiProfile` setting to configure the `mai` profile you are using
* createKioVersion: This will create a new version in kio of your application. The `kioTeamName`,
`kioApplicationName`, `kioApplicationVersion`,`dockerArtifactName` and `dockerVersion` settings
are used to configure the task

### Example of deployment pipeline

If your version of sbt is at least 0.13.8, you can use the following to deploy your application
in a single command (again assuming you are using sbt-docker)

```sbt
lazy val deploy = taskKey[Unit]("Deploys the application into Kio")

// Make our dockerPush login to pierone first
(dockerPush in docker) := (dockerPush in docker) dependsOn pierOneLogin

// Create a docker image, then push into pierone and then create a new version in kio
deploy := Def.sequential(
  docker,
  dockerPush in docker,
  createKioVersion
).value
```

Then you can simply run `deploy` in `sbt`, all you need to do afterwards is to update your
application with `senza`
